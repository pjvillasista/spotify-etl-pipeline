# Spotify Data Extraction and Transformation

## Introduction
This project was conceived to address the challenges faced by digital marketers and business analysts in understanding consumer music preferences and trends on Spotify. By automating the extraction and transformation of Spotify playlist data, we facilitate the creation of a robust dataset that can be used for market analysis, customer insight, and strategic decision-making.

## Business Problem
In the competitive music streaming industry, it's crucial for businesses to stay ahead by curating content that resonates with their target audience. However, analyzing vast amounts of raw data to discern trends and preferences can be overwhelming. There was a need for a solution that could systematically gather, process, and present Spotify data in a manner that is accessible and actionable for business strategists and marketers.

### Key Business Questions
- What genres or artists are currently trending among different user demographics?
- Which tracks are most frequently added to user-generated playlists, and what does that imply about listener preferences?
- How do audio features correlate with song popularity and listener engagement?

## Solution
To address these questions, we built a serverless data pipeline on AWS with two key Lambda functions:

### Extract Function
The extract function serves as the initial entry point, pulling raw playlist data from Spotify. This data contains rich insights into user behavior, such as song selections and playlist creation patterns.

### Transform and Load Function
The transformation stage is where raw data is processed into a structured and queryable format. The load process then stores this data in a way that's optimized for analysis, which can be directly utilized to answer our key business questions.

## Deployment Workflow
Utilizing AWS SAM, we streamlined the deployment of our Lambda functions with the following commands:

- `sam build` — Prepares the deployment package.
- `sam deploy` — Deploys the application to AWS, making it readily available for execution.

## Hypothetical Use Case
Imagine a scenario where a music production company wants to identify emerging artists to invest in. Using the transformed data from our project, they can:

- Analyze the popularity and engagement metrics of artists' tracks.
- Determine the correlation between audio features and listener preferences.
- Identify potential breakout artists based on genre trends and follower growth.

The insights gained from our pipeline empower the company to make data-driven decisions on artist contracts and promotional strategies.

## Challenges Encountered and Resolutions
We overcame several technical hurdles, such as dependency management and AWS deployment issues, by adopting AWS SAM and adhering to AWS's naming and configuration conventions.

## Future Work
We plan to complete the transformation logic, integrate additional data points such as user demographics, and establish a continuous deployment pipeline to facilitate real-time data analysis.

## Conclusion
This project delivers a scalable solution for businesses to leverage Spotify data in their strategic planning. The insights derived from our data pipeline offer a competitive edge in content curation, marketing, and trend analysis within the music streaming landscape.
