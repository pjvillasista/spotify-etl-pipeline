# Spotify Top 100 Analytics Engineering Project

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to create an end-to-end analytics engineering pipeline to extract, transform, load, analyze, and visualize data from Spotify's Top 100 global songs. We aim to provide insights into music trends, track popularity, and artist performance.

## Process Overview

### 1. Data Collection
- Collect data using the Spotify API.
- Store raw data in Amazon S3 in formats such as JSON, CSV, or Parquet.

### 2. Data Cataloging and ETL
- Catalog data using AWS Glue.
- Perform ETL operations to clean and prepare data for analysis.

### 3. Data Storage and Database
- Store and manage data using AWS services like Redshift, Aurora, or RDS.

### 4. Data Modeling
- Design and implement a relational database schema.
- Optimize schema for query performance.

### 5. SQL Querying
- Conduct exploratory data analysis using SQL.
- Create automated views and stored procedures for recurring analysis tasks.

### 6. Analytics and Machine Learning
- Analyze data trends and build machine learning models with AWS SageMaker, if applicable.
- Utilize Python and SQL for data analysis and statistical modeling.

### 7. Data Visualization and Reporting
- Connect BI tools to the database to create interactive dashboards.
- Visualize data to highlight insights and trends.

### 8. Automation and Orchestration
- Automate the data pipeline with AWS Step Functions or Apache Airflow.
- Schedule regular updates and data refreshes.

### 9. Monitoring and Optimization
- Monitor pipeline performance with AWS CloudWatch.
- Continuously optimize ETL jobs and SQL queries.

### 10. Deployment
- Use AWS services for deploying web applications or dashboards.
- Ensure all code is version-controlled.

### 11. Documentation and Presentation
- Document all aspects of the pipeline and project.
- Prepare summaries of methodologies and insights.
